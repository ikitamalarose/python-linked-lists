# Python Linked List Projects

This repository contains two projects that implement linked list data structures in Python: a command-line linked list operations program and a restaurant table reservation system.

## Project 2: Restaurant Table Reservation System
### Overview
The goal of this exercise is to create a linked list system that handles restaurant reservations. Each reservation contains information about the customer, the number of people in the party, and the reservation time. The system supports the following operations:

1. Adding reservations to the list.
2. Displaying all current reservations.
3. Deleting a reservation based on the customer's name.

### Example Reservations
The following sample reservations are included in the system:

- Jaden Smart: 2 people at 7pm
- Margo Robine: 1 person at 6pm
- Snow Fall: 5 people at 7pm
- Perry White: 2 people at 7am

### Usage
The main function creates a list of sample reservations, adds them to the system, displays the reservations, deletes a reservation by name, and shows the updated list.

## Project 1: Command Line Linked List Operations

### Overview

This program manages a singly linked list using command-line arguments. The linked list supports the following operations:

1. Adding values to the head of the list.
2. Adding values to the tail of the list.
3. Removing the head node of the list.

The program takes command-line input to specify which operation to perform and the value to be added (if applicable). The current state of the list is displayed after each operation.

### Command Line Usage

To use the program, run the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Add a value to the head of the list:**
   ```bash
   python file.py --head <value>
   ```
2. **Add a value to the tail of the list:**
    ```bash
   python file.py --tail <value>
    ```

3. **Remove the head node from the list:**
    ```bash
    python file.py --rmvhead
    ```
